---- GROUP 16 ----

David Olofsson <david.m.o@telia.com>
Rebecca Carlson <rm.carlson@hotmail.com>

---- PRELIMINARIES ----

Comments:
A fairly quick hackjob, since we are under pressure from a group project in
the parallell course. We hope it fulfills the requirements.
With any luck, the following ones will be better.

Additional sources:
Man-pages for the instructions, as well as a quick google to find some of them
by function.


			   COMMAND SHELL
			   =============

---- LOGISTICS ----

These questions will help us to keep track of the difficulty level of
assignments, as well as keeping track of which team members worked on
which parts.

David Olofsson: ~ 9h
Focus: Efficiency and correctness, features always taking the back seat.

Rebecca Carlson: ~ 4h
Focus: Understanding, comprehension of new concepts, learning.



			  SURVEY QUESTIONS
			  ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any of the parts of it, too
>> easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Were there any parts of the assignment that you felt were unnecessarily
>> tedious or pointless?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the instructor and/or TAs to more
>> effectively assist students, either for future quarters or the remaining
>> projects?

>> Any other comments?
